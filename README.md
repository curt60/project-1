#### Description:

Our target audience are people who are moviegoers that want to get information quickly, people who are movie buffs, people who want to know about any given movie, by entering information on our webpage to answer basic questions about a movie.

The problem that the site will address is to help people determine whether they want to watch a movie.  The problem is that there are tons of movies that are released each year and little time to watch all of them.  This site will help them answer whether watching a given movie is worth their time.   Our site is going to give the user information about what the masses think about the movie.  Our site will give them basic information about what the movie is about.  

The primary goal of the site is to solve the previously stated problem, quickly and efficiently.  It is also to provide a movie aggregated information without all of the fuss of other movie rating websites .  It streamlines and simplifies the movie websearch process and combines the best of other movie search sites into one package.  

The 3 main issues our site addressed are:
1.  Our site answered my questions what a movie was about. 
2.  Our site answered what the masses thought about a movie. 
3.  Our site helped me learn about what movies are currently showing.
